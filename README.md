### Color Scheme

To maintain simplicity and a minimalist aesthetic, he primary color scheme for the site is black and white. I also used Bootstrapâ€™s default colors to maintain consistency with the design patterns. These colors help to create a clean interface and incorporating an urban vibe.

### Typography

I used **Montserrat**, a modern sans-serif font, throughout the site. Its clean lines and readable design fit the overall minimalist theme.
